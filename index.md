# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Marcus McKinstry and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Engineering.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was one of my favorites; I liked it because it was one of the first labs that bridged the gap between computer science and math to convert a decimal amount of feet to feet and inches. I was able to separate a decimal value into its integer component and its decimal component. Using this, I calculated how many inches were in the decimal component, and returned the results. This worked for any given number, even negative ones. Most importantly, I learned how to manipulate the type of a variable’s value to use it in calculation, which has been a regularly used skill in even the more advanced labs.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was another one of my favorites because it created a fully functioning blackjack score calculator. I liked it so much because blackjack is one of my favorite card games to play with friends, and being able to build a calculator that works every time felt very rewarding. I learned how to take user input from the command line and manipulate it so that I could ultimately make calculations that result in a player’s end score. With this experience, I can begin to develop more and more game-scoring systems, possibly even creating an entire game myself.

* Lab 11

    Lab 1, part 2 was my final favorite lab activity; I liked it because it was where we began to delve into object-oriented programming which gave me additional coding skills to create more future projects. We were tasked with creating a guessing game that keeps track of how many turns a user has left before they get a “Game over” message. I learned how to store data and values inside of an object, and how to retrieve that information when needed. Decrementing the number of turns each time a user guesses while simultaneously checking if their guess is correct was a challenge, but it was rewarding to complete it.
