### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was one of my favorites because it was one of the first labs that bridged the gap between computer science and math to convert a decimal amount of feet to feet and inches. I was able to seperate a decimal value into its integer componenet and its decimal component. Using this, I was able to calculate how much inches was in the decimal component, and returned the results. This worked for any given number, even negative ones.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was another one of my favorites because it created a fully functioning blackjack score calculator. Blackjack is one of my favorite card games to play with friends, and being able to build a calculator that works every time felt very rewarding. I think with this experience, I can begin to develop more and more game scoring systems, possibly even creating an entire game myself.
